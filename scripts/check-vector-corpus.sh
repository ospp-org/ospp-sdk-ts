# Verify that the vendored CONFORMANCE VECTOR CORPUS is byte-identical to the
# spec source at the ref pinned in .spec-ref. The third byte-identity gate,
# after scripts/check-schemas.sh and scripts/check-crypto-vectors.sh, and the
# mirror of ospp-sdk-php's script of the same name.
#
# Vendored (src/test-vectors/) <- spec conformance/test-vectors/:
#   valid/     <- valid/       every positive vector, whole directory
#   invalid/   <- invalid/     every negative vector, whole directory
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# src/schemas/ has been byte-gated since v0.8.0 and tests/crypto/fixtures/ since
# 0.14.0. The conformance corpus — the 334 files that decide what this SDK
# accepts and refuses — had NOTHING. It was re-vendored by hand on every spec
# sync and its correctness rested on the maintainer having copied the right
# tree. A vector edited in place, a vector the spec added and nobody vendored, a
# vector the spec deleted and nobody removed: all three land SILENTLY. The suite
# stays green, because SchemaValidator.test.ts validates whatever vectors are
# present against whatever schemas are present, and both halves being locally
# consistent is not the same as either being upstream-correct.
#
# The `toBe(329)` literal in that test was the only thing standing in for this,
# and it is a second copy of a fact about the corpus rather than a check on it —
# a number a human bumps by hand, whose failure lands on whoever did the
# re-vendor correctly.
#
# SCOPE — whole-directory diff, deliberately.
#
# This SDK vendors the COMPLETE valid/ and invalid/ sets (163 + 171 at spec
# v0.25.0), not a subset, so "every vendored vector matches" and "the directory
# matches" are the same assertion. The directory form is the stronger one: it
# also catches a vector DELETED from the vendored copy and one ADDED to the spec
# and never vendored, which a per-file list cannot. Do NOT narrow this to a
# hand-maintained file list — a list is a second place to forget, and it fails
# silently by going green.
#
# NOT covered here: conformance/test-vectors/crypto/. That subset is genuinely a
# subset, lives under tests/crypto/fixtures/ rather than src/test-vectors/, and
# scripts/check-crypto-vectors.sh already pins it against the spec by name.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-vector-corpus.sh                       # clones spec at .spec-ref
#   SPEC_REPO=/local/path scripts/check-vector-corpus.sh # diffs a local checkout
#
# Exit: 0 if byte-identical, 1 otherwise.
